  FINAL COMPILATION FIX
========================================

Step 1: Checking Hardhat installation...
Hardhat is installed locally.

Step 2: Opening LoanNFT.sol for manual edit...
Please delete the SECOND supportsInterface function (around line 429)

Step 3: Checking LoanNFT inheritance...
If contract doesn't inherit from ERC721, change to:
  Option A: Add ERC721 to inheritance
  Option B: Simplify to ERC721URIStorage, AccessControl only

Step 4: Checking GovernanceDAO.sol...
Verify line 521 calls _executeOperations not _execute

Step 5: Compiling with local installation...

ParserError: Expected pragma, import directive or contract/interface/library/struct/enum/constant/function/error definition.
